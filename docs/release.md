# Release

Tag a commit on `main` whose `lint` run passed with a plain semver (`X.Y.Z`, no `v`). The
release-tag workflow stamps the version, pushes `oci://ghcr.io/krateo-blueprints/charts/krateo-openstack-federation:X.Y.Z`
and publishes the same archive to the Marketplace index (channel `blueprints`). Verify that the OCI
archive's sha256 equals the index entry's digest.
